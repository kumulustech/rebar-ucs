install server:
 - create LLD->data file mapping, do we even need to build a datafile, or can we manage vi direct compilation (how to deal with generated data such as mac addresses, UUIDs, etc.)
 - map network settings to rebar "admin and bmc" network definitions, others? (storage, public, api, etc)


investigate:
 - updating digitalrebar install for install-server config (updates and tweaks?)
